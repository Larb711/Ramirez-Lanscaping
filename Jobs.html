        <p>I'm Luis Ramirez and I come from Oakland California. I come from a low income family and have had difficulties with finances. I have a passion for technology and  consider myself pretty good with hands on tech.  I have taught myself how to continue growing without others telling me what I can do and what I can't do. I have grown to a state where others have came to me for advice and I think that is pretty nice because people actually care about your opinion.

        <p >
           I like to do many things, but the things I focus on the most are Math, Technology, Photography and Poetry. Math is something I enjoy when I'm bored, Technology is what I need to be successful, Photography is a hobby while as Poetry is a necessity.

I enjoy walking, hiking and running because it relives my stress and anxiety when I am feeling down. In my free time at school I hang out with my friends but most times I enjoy being alone with my music.
